This repository contains code related to the accepted paper titled "Empowering human-like walking with a bio-inspired gait controller for an under-actuated torque- driven human model". It includes three main folders:

Simulation: Allows simulation of the Skeletal Human model equipped with a Gait Controller.

Optimization: Provides tools for optimizing the gains of the gait controller and the Balance Distribution Coefficient (BDC).

Results: Contains simulation results of the model for a six-cycle gait.
